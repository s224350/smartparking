# EzPark - Smartparking
This is the project of group 3 for course 34346

This repository contains the following 4 directories
- "Cloud VM", is the code for the backend
- "MainController", is the arduino code for the arduino DUO being used as the main controller
- "ParkingSpot", is the arduino code for the parking spot entities. The code includes a variable called "spotID", which determines which parking spot the parking spot entity resides on
